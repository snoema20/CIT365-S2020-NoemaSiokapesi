        "And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, cand blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

        And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;

        For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins". - Mathew 26: 26-28
